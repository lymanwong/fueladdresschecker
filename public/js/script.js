"C#":"Invalid city/state/zip. - The ZIP Code in the submitted address could not be found because neither a valid city and state, nor valid 5-digit ZIP Code was present. The API recommends that the customer check the accuracy of the submitted address.",
"D#":"No ZIP + 4 assigned - This address is not present in the USPS data. The API recommends that the customer check the accuracy of the submitted address.",
"E#":"Same ZIP for multiple - Multiple records were returned, with the same 5-digit ZIP Code.",
"F#":"Address not found - The address, exactly as submitted, could not be found in the city, state, or ZIP Code provided. Either the primary number is missing, the street is missing, or the street is too badly misspelled to understand.",
"G#":"Used addressee data - Information in the addressee input field was determined to be part of the address. It was moved out of the addressee field and incorporated into the street field.",
"H#":"Missing secondary number - The address as submitted is missing a secondary number (apartment, suite, etc.). The API recommends that the customer check the accuracy of the submitted address and add the missing secondary number to ensure the correct Delivery Point Barcode (DPBC).",
"I#":"Insufficent/incorrect address data - More than one ZIP+4 Code was found to satisfy the address as submitted. The submitted address did not contain sufficiently complete or correct data to determine a single ZIP+4 Code. the API recommends that the customer check the accuracy and completeness of the submitted address. For example, a street may have a similar address at both the north and south ends of the street.",
"J#":"Dual address - The input contained two addresses. For example: 123 MAIN ST PO BOX 99.",

"LL#":"Flagged address for LACSLink - The input address matched a record that was LACS-indicated, that was submitted to LACSLink for processing. This does not mean that the address was converted; it only means that the address was submitted to LACSLink because the input address had the LACS indicator set.",

This does not mean that the address was converted; it only means that the address was submitted to LACSLink because the input address had the LACS indicator set.",

"P#":"Better address exists - The delivery address is matchable, but it is known by another (preferred) name. For example, in New York, NY, AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS is also known as 6TH AVE. An inquiry using a delivery address of 39 6th Avenue would be flagged with Footnote P.",

"T#":"Multiple response due to magnet street syndrome - The search resulted in a single response; however, the record matched was flagged as having magnet street syndrome, and the input street name components (pre-directional, primary street name, post-directional, and suffix) did not exactly match those of the record. A magnet street is one having a primary street name that is also a suffix or directional word, having either a post-directional or a suffix (i.e., 2220 PARK MEMPHIS TN logically matches to a ZIP+4 record 2200-2258 PARK AVE MEMPHIS TN 38114-6610), but the input address lacks the suffix AVE which is present on the ZIP+4 record. The primary street name PARK is a suffix word. The record has either a suffix or a post-directional present. Therefore, in accordance with CASS requirements, a ZIP+4 Code must not be returned. The multiple response return code is given since a no match would prevent the best candidate.",
